# Fireworks AI Chatbot API Integration with Image Input

This Python script demonstrates how to integrate with the Fireworks AI Chatbot API to generate responses based on user input, including text and image data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- Python installed on your system
- An API key from Fireworks AI. You can obtain this by signing up for their service and creating an API key.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Replace `<MY_API_KEY>` in the script with your actual Fireworks AI API key.

3. Replace `MY_BASE_64 CODE` with the base64 encoded image data you want to provide as input to the chatbot.

4. Ensure your input payload (`payload` dictionary) is configured according to your requirements. Adjust parameters such as `model`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `temperature`, etc., based on your desired chatbot behavior.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot_image_input.py
    ```

2. Upon execution, the script sends a POST request to the Fireworks AI API with the user input provided in the payload, including text and image data.

3. The API returns a response containing the chatbot's reply.

4. The script then extracts and prints the chatbot's response.

## Script Explanation

- `base64code`: Base64 encoded image data to be included in the user input.
- `url`: The endpoint for the Fireworks AI Chatbot API.
- `payload`: Configuration parameters including the model to use, maximum tokens, presence penalty, etc. Adjust these parameters as needed. The payload now includes both text and image data in the user message.
- `headers`: HTTP headers including content type and authorization. Replace `<MY_API_KEY>` with your actual API key.
- `response`: Sends a POST request to the API and captures the response.
- `llm_response`: Extracts the chatbot's response from the API response and prints it.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you comply with Fireworks AI's terms of service and usage policies when using their API.
- This script provides a basic example of interacting with the Fireworks AI API using both text and image data as input. For more complex interactions or integrations, consult the Fireworks AI API documentation.
